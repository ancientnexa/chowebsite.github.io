									<h3 class="subtitle">Ahri</h3>
									<p class="description">Innately connected to the spirit world, Ahri possesses a fox-like grace. She weaves magic, manipulating emotions and consuming the very essence of her prey. With each soul devoured, she gains flashes of memory and insight. Picture her as a cosmic thief, stealing secrets from the hearts of those she encounters.
		
										But there’s more: Ahri is a charismatic captain, leading a team of Star Guardians across the cosmos. Her past holds pain—the loss of teammates—but now, she fiercely protects her newfound family. No one she cares for shall fade away again.
										
										So, whether you seek arcane power or cosmic camaraderie, Ahri awaits your summoning. Just beware: her charm is as deadly as her spells.</p>

									<h3 class="subtitle">Draven</h3>
									<p class="description">Draven is a tall, muscular man with fair skin and dark brown or black hair. His eyes—sometimes brown, gray, or green—hold a glint of mischief. His body bears reddish tattoos—bold, angular lines that tell tales of battles won and crowds awed. And then there’s that iconic mustache—a thin blade of facial hair that defies physics by extending past his jawline. It’s like he’s saying, “Why settle for ordinary when you can have extraordinary?”</p>

									<h3 class="subtitle">Kai'sa</h3>
									<p class="description">Kai’Sa dances on the edge of roles: part Marksman, part Mage. She wields both her plasma-infused basic attacks and her void-touched abilities with finesse. Her attack range may be minimal, but she compensates by diving headlong into the fray, picking off targets, and maneuvering through team fights like a cosmic predator. She waits for that perfect moment—the heartbeat before all hell breaks loose—to unleash her full potential. </p>

									<h3 class="subtitle">Master Yi</h3>
									<p class="description">Master Yi—the Wuju Bladesman—slices through the Rift with grace and precision. His double strikes, cosmic vanishing acts, and ultimate speed make him a force to be reckoned with. Whether you’re chasing pentakills or seeking enlightenment, remember: the path of the blades leads to victory</p>

									<img src="images/img5.jpg" alt="Image 5" style="height: 150px;">
									<h3 class="subtitle">Seraphine</h3>
									<p class="description">Seraphine—the soulful songstress—treads the Rift like a melody waiting to be sung. Her abilities resonate with magic, and her skins shimmer like starlight. Whether you’re hitting high notes or dropping cosmic beats, remember: in the symphony of League, you’re the conductor. </p>

									<h3 class="subtitle">Lee sin</h3>
									<p class="description">Lee Sin—the Blind Monk—moves through the Rift with unwavering determination. His martial prowess, despite his lack of sight, is a testament to his discipline and devotion. Whether you’re landing a resonating kick or weaving through the jungle like a shadow, remember: true strength lies within. </p>
